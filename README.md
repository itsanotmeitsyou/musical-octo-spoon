# NFT is a HOAX
Tel Aviv museum has failed their job critiquing NFTs and instead chose to join the marketing campaign aimed to get people's money. All this is in a time where people are loosing their money in collapsing NFT markets and countless scams taking place. 

As a response we created this empty exhibition, performing a virtual art heist.
